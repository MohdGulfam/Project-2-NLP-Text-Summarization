# Project-2_Text-Summarization_NLP
Text Summarization is the process of creating a summary of a certain document which contains the most important information of the original, the purpose of which is to obtain a summary of the main points of the document
There is a huge amount of data appearing digitally, so it is necessary to develop a unique procedure to immediately summarize long texts while keeping the main idea. Text summarization also makes it possible to shorten the reading time, speed up information searches and obtain as much information as possible on a subject.
The main goal of using NLP for text summarization is to reduce the reference text to a smaller version while keeping its knowledge alongside its meaning.
